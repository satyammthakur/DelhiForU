      <h1>Our History</h1>
      <p>
      Just a century ago, the British moved the seat of their empire from Kolkata to Delhi. 
      And it has been the Capital of India ever since. 
      Now a thriving, cosmopolitan metro, the city has much to celebrate 
      as it has already reached the milestone of completing 100 years as a Capital. 
      With a history that goes back many centuries, Delhi showcases an ancient 
      culture and a rapidly modernising country. Dotted with monuments there is much to discover here.
      The seat of many powerful empires in the past, its long history can be 
      traced in its many carefully-preserved monuments, ancient forts and tombs.
      All this is combined with the best features of a modern city such as a metro system, 
      bustling markets and fabulous eating places. The past and the 
      present meld seamlessly together, making centuries-old monuments a part 
      of the city’s daily life. Delhi is very much a history’s child. 
      The story of the city is as old as the epic Mahabharata, when the town was known as Indraprastha, 
      where Pandavas used to live. Over the centuries, eight more cities came alive.
